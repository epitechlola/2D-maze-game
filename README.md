# 2D-maze-game

Welcome to the 2D maze game! This Java project is an interactive game where players navigate a maze, collect items, and escape from a pursuing enemy. The game offers three difficulty levels with varying challenges and gameplay experiences.

## Features

- **Maze Exploration:** Navigate through procedurally generated mazes.
- **Enemy AI:** An intelligent enemy chases the player using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- **Item Interactions:** Discover chests containing various items: points, bonuses, and maluses.
- **Bush Hiding:** Utilize bushes to momentarily evade the enemy's pursuit.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the `maze_app/src/main/java/maze_app/MazeApplication.java` file to start the game.

## Gameplay

- **Controls:**
  - Use arrow keys or ZQSD to move the adventurer.
  - Interact with chests and exit (you need to interact with the exit on the bottom rigth of the maze to win the game) using E or SPACE.

- **Objectives:**
  - Collect items from chests to earn points and bonuses.
  - Evade the pursuing enemy and reach the maze's exit to win.
  - Navigate through different difficulty levels, each with unique challenges.
